# SCALA FRACTAL GENERATOR

  In this Scala course related project, you will be able to generate two fractals : MandelBrot and Julia !
  
  ## Run the code
  
  To run the code : 
  -  you have to have metals and sbt installed ( Visual Code editor ) 
  - then simply run with the command : 
  
  ```bash
sbt run
```

  
  ### Feel free to choose between 3 options :
    1 -> Display the Mandelbrot fractal
    2 -> Display the Julia fractal of your choice (7 types of Julia available)
    0 -> If you have seen enough fractals, quit the program.
